1) Dynamic websites / Angular / Infinite Scroll Problem - done
2) title tracking - highest priority


make colors feature tracking
set colors initial


way to learn brands. brands extraction from title feature isn't possible
or maybe collect a possible brands for manual submit
(brands I can track from lyst.com or ebay
also need to test lyst.com
)

same with category



the items tracking itself:

save items with hash
build hash based on features
